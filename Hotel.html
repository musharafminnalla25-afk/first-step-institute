        <h1>Food</h1>
        <p><b>Food is any substance consumed by an organism for nutritional support. Food is usually of plant, animal,
                or fungal origin and contains essential nutrients such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or
                minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide
                energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth. Different species of animals have different feeding
                behaviours that satisfy the needs of their metabolisms and have evolved to fill a specific ecological
                niche within specific geographical contexts.

                Omnivorous humans are highly adaptable and have adapted to obtaining food in many different ecosystems.
                Humans generally use cooking to prepare food for consumption. The majority of the food energy required
                is supplied by the industrial food industry, which produces food through intensive agriculture and
                distributes it through complex food processing and food distribution systems. This system of
                conventional agriculture relies heavily on fossil fuels, which means that the food and agricultural
                systems are one of the major contributors to climate change, accounting for as much as 37% of total
                greenhouse gas emissions.[1]</b></p>
