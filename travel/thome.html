    <h1>WELCOME TO MMM TRAVELS</h1>
    <div class="data">
        <p> Travel is the activity of going from one place to another place.[1] When a person makes the same trip every
            day to work or school, this type of traveling is usually called "commuting." Some people travel to other
            cities as part of their job. This is called "business travel." When many people travel to a distant place to
            stay, it is called "human migration".

            Some people travel on their vacation, to visit other towns, cities, or countries. This is tourism. These
            people stay overnight in hotels, hostels, motels, apartments or bed and breakfast. Some prefer camping.
            Through the centuries, modes of travel have changed. Some people (travel writers) write about travelling, as
            in autobiographies or journals. Some write guide books suggesting places to go.</p>
