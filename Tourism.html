            <li><b>Charminar</b>

                    The Charminar's long history includes the existence of a mosque on its top floor for more than 434
                    years. While both historically and religiously significant, it is also known for its popular and
                    busy
                    local markets surrounding the structure, and has become one of the most frequented tourist

    <li><b>Golconda Fort</b>
        <p>Golconda is a fortified citadel and ruined city located on the western outskirts of Hyderabad, Telangana,
            India.[1][2] The fort was originally built by Kakatiya ruler Pratāparudra in the 11th century out of mud
            walls.[3] It was ceded to the Bahmani Kings from Musunuri Nayakas during the reign of the Bahmani Sultan
            Mohammed Shah I, during the first Bahmani-Vijayanagar War. Following the death of Sultan Mahmood Shah,
            the Sultanate disintegrated and Sultan Quli, who had been appointed as the Governor of Hyderabad by the
            Bahmani Kings, fortified the city and made it the capital of the Golconda Sultanate. Because of the
            vicinity of diamond mines, especially Kollur Mine, Golconda flourished as a trade centre of large
            diamonds known as Golconda Diamonds. Golconda fort is currently abandoned and in ruins. The complex was
            put by UNESCO on its "tentative list" to become a World Heritage Site in 2014, with other forts in the
            region, under the name Monuments and Forts of the Deccan Sultanate (despite there being a number of
            different sultanates).[1]</p>

                Mahanandi is one of the Nava Nandis. The Mahanandiswara Swamy Temple, an important shrine, is located
                here. This ancient temple dates back over 1,500 years. The inscriptions of 10th century tablets speak of
                the temple being repaired and rebuilt several times.[1]

                These nine temples are Mahanandi, Sivanandi, Vinayakanandi, Somanandi, Prathamanandi, Garudanandi,
                Suryanandi, Krishnanandi (also called Vishnunandi) and Naganandi.[2]

                via giddalur road is the longer option, around 24 km from Nandyal.</p>
